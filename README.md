# assignment

When you want to run the program, please checkout the solution to a folder (for example C:\AssignTest.) and build the solution using your IDE or GIT CMD line.
You can then run the solution either from the IDE tool or else from command promt go to the check out folder (for example C:\AssignTest\out\artifacts\) and run the command java -jar AssignTest.jar
When you run the command line program, it will ask the user to select the input file (sample file has been commited with the solution C:\AssignTest\treeInput)
Once you run the soltuion, the output will be displayed to command line and to the output file (output.txt) which is located at the check out folder ( for example C:\AssignTest).
